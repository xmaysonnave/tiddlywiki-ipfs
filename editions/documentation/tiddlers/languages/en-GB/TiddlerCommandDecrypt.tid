<p>
  If the locker is closed your wiki is encrypted or will be encrypted once saved.
</p>
<p>
  A password will be requested to unlock your wiki when loaded.
</p>
<p>
  External resources are automatically unencrypted when their host Tiddlers are displayed.
</p>
<p>
  While unencrypting an external resource, a password could be requested:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the wiki is unencrypted but its external resource is encrypted</li>
  <li>When the wiki is encrypted but the encrypted external resource uses a different password</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
[[IPFS - Encrypted - The Little Prince]] describes this behaviour.
</p>
<p>
  Edit the this Tiddler as it contains a <b>password</b> field . Its value when used will unencrypt the external resource.
